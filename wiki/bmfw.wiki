== Block Maker FrameWork ==
  * What is this?
  It's a multi-plugin framework to allow developers build their own type of blocks for maps.

  * Why you made this?
  Because I see too many people asking for support to modify some other plugins for blocks and I think it's very annoying to modify.

  * What's change with this plugin framework?
  You can make your own block without any needs to modify the core plugin.

  * I can do anything with my block?
  Yes, you can do anything but I suggest try to limit to function calls available in this framework to avoid high cpu usage in your own block.

  * Can I ask you to make some blocks for me?
  No. Read the api, it's very simple. Anything else is up to you.

== API Details ==

There's a native function to register your block, then there's some standard calls handled by core plugin you may want to use.
