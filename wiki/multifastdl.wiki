= Introduction =

This plugin is intended to distribute multiple fast download servers.

= Details =

When a client connects to the server, cvar sv_downloadurl will be changed to one of the configured fastdl servers.

Just create the file *multifastdl.ini* in your *configs* directory and put one line for each fastdl url as you will put in sv_downloadurl cvar.
