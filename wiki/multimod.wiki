== Multimod v2.0 Beta1 ==
  * Removed a lot of code
  * Removed map voting
  * Added compatibility with galileo (not tested)
  * Added semi-compatibility with mapchooser (requiers mapchooser patched)
  * In this beta is not working the custom cvars file

== Mapchooser Patched ==
  * Added only 2 lines of code to the original mapchooser

= Instructions =
  * Compile and put your plugins in plugins folder
  * Create file multimod.ini in addons/amxmodx/configs folder (see format)
  * Create one file for each mod that contain desired plugins for that mod (same format as plugins.ini)
    The name of the file must be in the form of TAG-plugins.ini
    Include all amxx desired plugins
    Include galileo or mapchooser_multimod (not both!)
    Include all multimod plugin
  * Create a multimod folder in cstrike (somedir/cstrike/multimod)
  * Put in multimod folder one file for each mod that containt desired maps for that mod
  * The name of the file must be in the form of TAG-maps.ini

 How it works?
  * This plugin doesn't move, rename nor create files on the fly
  * This plugin doesn't have a map voting code at this time
  * This plugin will restart the server at first run to setup correctly
  * After first restart, default plugins.ini will not be loaded anymore
  * When there's 3 minutes left for the current map, this plugin will bring a menu for MOD voting
  * Then, mapchooser/galileo will have time to work on map voting

EXAMPLE

* multimod.ini format example
Quote:
;mode name:mod tag:custom cvars cfg file
[Gun Game]:[gungame]:[gungame-config.cfg]
[Paint Ball]:[paintball]:[paintball-config.cfg]
[Hid'N Seek]:[hns]:[hns-config.cfg]
* With this example you will need to create:

Quote:
multimod/gungame-maps.ini
multimod/paintball-maps.ini
multimod/hns-maps.ini
addons/amxmodx/configs/gungame-plugins.ini
addons/amxmodx/configs/paintball-plugins.ini
addons/amxmodx/configs/hns-plugins.ini

*.cfg files are not needed to be created at this time

I'm sure I'm missing something but everyone can post here and will get support.

Please, test with this mapchooser_multimod (tested by me without problems).
I need someone who can test for
* CZ compatibility
* Galileo compatibility
